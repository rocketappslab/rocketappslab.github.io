About
======
Dr. YU Wing Yin received his BSc degree with First Class Honors and his PhD degree from City University of Hong Kong in 2019 and 2023. Currently, he joins Noah’s Ark Lab Huawei Hong Kong as a senior researcher working on developing [PanguLLM](https://shorturl.at/SPRY9) and [OptVerse](https://shorturl.at/oowlU) AI Solver – a mathematical optimization modeling tool for industrial application . He published many papers on top peer-reviewed AI-related conferences and journals including ICCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, COLING, TIP, TCSVT, etc. His research interests include large language model for optimization modeling/reasoning, reinforcement learning with human feedback and image/video Generation.
